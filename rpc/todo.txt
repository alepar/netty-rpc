 - everything async (no return values, no exceptions, immediate return)
 - exceptions go to a common handler
 - ClientId
 - callback on client accept/death

 - daemon threads

 - shutdown server before client - hangs - wtf???

 - waitFor feature on client/peer (timeout)  --  executeAndWait - wait until message is received and handled, no return values, unfreeze if Remote/Transport exceptions happen
 - peer-to-peer mode

 - validate interface on registering it in rpc client/server
 - check if interface is registered on server side before returning client proxy

 - compression
 - encryption
 - authentication

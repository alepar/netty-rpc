 - shutdown server before client - hangs - wtf???

 - timeouts
 - thread-safe client proxies (that will be a blast ;-) - or get one proxy per thread? - nah - one channel, many InvocResponses - it doesn't know how to handle those yet
 - validate interface on registering it in rpc client/server
 - check if interface is registered on server side before returning client proxy
 - daemon threads

 - authentication
 - compression
